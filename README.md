# 🎨 Generative-Art-on-EditArt

Welcome to **Generative-Art-on-EditArt** — a minimalist code gallery where **one file** becomes infinite worlds.
Each project here is a single `index.js` script, designed to be pasted directly into **[EditArt.xyz](https://editart.xyz)** — a platform where **algorithms become art**, and every slider turns randomness into beauty.

---

## 💡 What Is This?

This repository is a **curated collection of generative artworks**, each built as a compact, self-contained JavaScript file.
No folders of assets. No HTML. No setup.
Just pure, expressive code — written to live and evolve inside EditArt’s creative environment.

The goal? To make art that is:

* Visually mesmerizing 💫
* Mathematically inspired 🔢
* Infinitely variable ♾️
* Blockchain-ready for minting on **EditArt.xyz** 🔗

Every run of the code produces a new visual — a singular expression of randomness and rhythm.

---

## 🛠️ What’s Inside

Only one thing:

```
index.js
```

That’s it.
Each `index.js` file is a **standalone generative artwork** — written for the EditArt platform’s built-in JavaScript renderer.

* 🧠 **JavaScript (ES6)** — The language of logic and light.
* 🎨 **EditArt Runtime** — Handles the canvas, rendering, and sliders for live parameter control.
* ⚡ **No dependencies** — Just copy and paste the code into EditArt, and it runs instantly.

🗂️ Folder structure example:

```
Generative-Art-on-EditArt/
├── Digital-Pollen/
│   └── index.js
├── Loom-of-Light/
│   └── index.js
└── README.md
```

Each folder = one artwork.
Each `index.js` = a full generative world.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Want to bring these works to life?
Here’s how:

### 1️⃣ Visit My Gallery

👉 [**Reyrove on EditArt**](https://www.editart.xyz/user/tz1RXsijmPeeF1kPyrhd8Hkm2RskJAeU3si5)

### 2️⃣ Pick a Project

Open a folder like `Digital-Pollen` or `Loom-of-Light`.

### 3️⃣ Copy the Code

Open the `index.js` file — it’s the whole project.

### 4️⃣ Paste into EditArt

* Go to [editart.xyz](https://editart.xyz)
* Create a new artwork
* Paste the entire `index.js` into the code editor
* Run it to see your unique generative piece

Every slider tweak = a new creation.
Every mint = a one-of-a-kind artifact.

## 🔥 Featured Works

### 🌺 **Digital Pollen**

A blooming dance of coded particles — floating like pollen through invisible air currents.
Each render drifts into new formations of motion, light, and entropy.

> *“Nature doesn’t repeat, and neither does this code.”*

---

### 🧵 **Loom of Light**

A tapestry woven from photons and equations.
Light behaves like thread — bending, overlapping, and glowing with structured randomness.

> *“Every beam is a thread. Every run, a new weave.”*

---

## 🧪 Play & Experiment

Every project is a creative sandbox.
Want to personalize a piece? Try changing:

* 🎨 Color palettes
* 🌀 Noise parameters
* ⚡ Animation speed
* 💠 Line thickness or geometry
* 🍀 Random seed initialization

No rules. No limits.
Every tweak reveals another version of the infinite.

## 🪙 Ready to Mint?

Mint your creation directly on **[EditArt.xyz](https://editart.xyz)** — a platform made for artists who code.
Each mint captures the **unique state and parameters** of your render, sealing it permanently on the blockchain.

It’s not just a copy — it’s a **computational signature**, a moment in digital time.
